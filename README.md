# Portfolio Project 1: Nashville Housing
#### This is my first self-directed portfolio project, where I took a raw dataset containing Nashville housing data found online and conducted an anlysis on it with MySQL, Python and Tableau.
#### I set up a MySQL Server on my personal computer, and since there is a known error with uploading CSVs with certain collation types to the MySQL server on Macbook, I used Numbers on my Macbook to convert the csv to a format I was able to import into the server successfully. All sql database functions performed in the "data cleaning file" were performed using the MySQL extension in VS Code.
### Questions I sought to answer with my analysis:
#### 1. Which month had the highest average home sale value?
#### 2. Which month of the year are most homes typically sold in?
#### 3. What percentage of homes sold had 3 bedrooms? 4 bedrooms?
#### 4. What year were most of the homes sold built in?
#### 5. Is there a relationship between the year built and sale price? Between land use type and sale price?
