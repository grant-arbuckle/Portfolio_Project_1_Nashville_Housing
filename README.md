# Portfolio Project 1: Nashville Housing Data Analysis
#### This is my first self-directed portfolio project, where I took a raw dataset containing Nashville housing data found online and conducted an anlysis on it with MySQL, Python and Tableau.
#### I set up a MySQL Server on my personal computer, and since there is a known error with uploading CSVs with certain collation types to the MySQL server on Macbook, I used Numbers on my Macbook to convert the csv to a format I was able to successfully. All sql database functions performed in the "data cleaning file" were performed using the MySQL extension in VS Code.
