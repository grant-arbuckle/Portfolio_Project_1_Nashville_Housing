# Portfolio Project 1: SQL Analysis
This is my first self-directed portfolio project, where I took a raw file containing Nashville housing data supplied by Alex The Analyst and conducted an anlysis on it with MySQL and Tableau. I set up a MySQL Server on my personal computer, and since there is a known error with uploading CSVs with certain collation types to the server on Macbook, I figured out how to convert the csv to a useful format in Numbers on my Macbook.
