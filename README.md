# Portfolio Project 1: Nashville Housing Data Analysis
#### This is my first self-directed portfolio project, where I took a raw dataset containing Nashville housing data found online and conducted an anlysis on it with MySQL, Python and Tableau.
#### I set up a MySQL Server on my personal computer, and since there is a known error with uploading CSVs with certain collation types to the MySQL server on Macbook, I used Numbers on my Macbook to convert the csv to a format I was able to successfully. All sql database functions performed in the "data cleaning file" were performed using the MySQL extension in VS Code.
### Questions I sought to answer with my analysis:
#### 1. In which zipcodes did the highest home sales occur?
#### 2. What was the distribution of number of bedrooms per home? Number of full baths? Number of half baths?
#### 3. What percentage of homes sold had 3 bedrooms? 4 bedrooms?
#### 4. What year were most of the homes sold built in?
#### 5. Which month are most homes sold in?
#### 6. Is there a relationship between the year built and sale price? Between land use type and sale price? Between total value and sale price?
